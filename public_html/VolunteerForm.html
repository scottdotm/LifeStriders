                                             LifeStriders relies greatly on volunteers as important members of the team who provide services to and assist our
                                             clients. We also recognize the extreme importance of the safety and well-being of our clients, volunteers, staff,
                                             guests and animals. All Volunteers and guests (guests = participants, siblings, parents, other relatives, friends) are
                                             expected to follow LifeStriders rules and policies and may not engage in disruptive, unsafe or inappropriate
                                             behavior. In the event a volunteer or guest does not comply, the following actions may be taken:
