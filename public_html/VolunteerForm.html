<p>Volunteer and Guests Liability Release <br>
    As a volunteer at LifeStriders: I acknowledge the risk of a horseback-riding program. However, I 
    feel that the possible benefits to myself and the clients I work with, are greater than the risk 
    I assume. I hereby, intending to be legally bound, for myself, my heirs and assigns, executors or 
    administrators waive, and release forever all claims for damage against LifeStriders Inc., its 
    Board of Directors, instructors, therapists, volunteers, and or employees for any and all injuries 
    and or losses I may sustain, while participating in LifeStriders program.  All Volunteers and 
    guests (guests = participants, siblings, parents, other relatives, friends) entering LifeStriders 
    premises understand that they will be in contact with animals, and assume the risk of injury, and 
    that it is possible that I or my guest(s) be bitten, scratched, and/or otherwise injured while on 
    LifeStriders premises. I also understand that I or my guest(s) may be exposed to equine and/or 
    other animal illness and disease and that it is also possible that I or my guest(s) could indirectly 
    expose other animals to such illness and disease. My signature to this liability release attests to 
    my, and my guest(s) intent to hold harmless and release from all liability against LifeStriders Inc., 
    its Board of Directors, instructors, therapists, volunteers, and or employees for any and all 
    injuries and or losses I or my guest(s) may sustain, while attending LifeStriders premises.</p>
